            ESFJ (Consul) is a personality type with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.
            <br /><br />
            For people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls), life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. These social individuals form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.
            <br /><br />
            This doesn’t mean that they are saints or that they like everyone. In fact, they are much more likely to form close bonds with people who share their same values and opinions. But regardless of other people’s beliefs, ESFJ personalities still strongly believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, they often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.

            <h3>The Beauty of a Responsible Life</h3>
            People with the ESFJ personality type are altruists. They take seriously their responsibility to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. And they believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, ESFJs may find it difficult to not judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, they often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them or chooses to walk a path that they do not understand.
            <br /><br />
            <div className="blue-txt">ESFJs have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people’s actions don’t align with it.</div>
            <br />
            With their definite views on right and wrong, these personalities tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. ESFJs know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others.
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Building Relationships That Last</h3>
            Supportive and outgoing, people with the ESFJ personality type can always be spotted at a party – they’re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone is having a good time! But make no mistake: they don’t just breeze through other people’s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand – or a listening ear – is needed. In fact, knowing that there are people out there who rely on them and need them tends to fill the cups of these generous types.

            <div className="blue-txt">People with the ESFJ personality type rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends’ and loved ones’ lives to memory.</div>
            <br />
            With their love of order and structure, ESFJs prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they might take it personally if someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts.
            <br /><br />
            For many people with the ESFJ personality type, one of life’s greatest challenges is accepting that they can’t control anyone else’s thoughts or behavior – not even those who are nearest and dearest to them. Fortunately, they can find peace and fulfillment by focusing on what they do best: setting an example of care, consideration, and responsibility – and bringing people together in the process.
